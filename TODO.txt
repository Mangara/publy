============================= DONE

- Hide all other abstracts when linked to a particular one. Also make sure to actually -show- it, not hide it if it's already shown.
- Journal version link
- Add DOI to BibTeX if available
- Unique id for each navigation link on publications list
- Automatically generate a sitemap.xml from a sitemap.txt

=========== Changes to style:

- New class:
.collapsible {
 display: none;
}



============================= TODO

=========== Main webpage:

- Pick a nicer font, especially for the title. It should be easy to read for the publication list and mesh well with the formulas in the abstracts.
 x http://www.google.com/fonts/ (Perhaps http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto or its condensed version?)
 x http://www.fontsquirrel.com/
- Pick a nicer colour scheme? Perhaps topaz from http://www.december.com/html/spec/colorshades.html
 (Maybe steal a few layout ideas from Luis)
- 5 Box layout from http://designshack.net/articles/layouts/10-rock-solid-website-layout-examples/
 x Boxes at the top, as navigation links with icons a la http://ottersurfboards.co.uk/
 x Publications link should be most prominent (in the middle and larger?)
- Add images to the front site that link to specific papers (Cartogram, canonical triangle, etc.)
 x Below main content?
- Recent, or highlighted publications on main page?

=========== Publications list:

- Option to list all authors vs all except for me
- Move away from "javascript:" links and towards unobtrusive JS:
 x Use <button> elements for things that aren't actually links
 x Add onclick bahaviour with jQuery, retrieving the id to be toggled from the id of the link clicked.
 x http://icant.co.uk/articles/seven-rules-of-unobtrusive-javascript/
- Add a 'results from: last year - last 5 years - last 10 years - all' filter
- Highlight paper when jumping to a specififc one
- More dynamic resizing of the text?
 x Automatically abbreviate conferences on narrow screens?
 x Use two line for navigation and intro line
 x Wrap authors
- Expand information for each paper to the right if there is room? (Highlight a paper, click, slide additional info to the right? a la google preview)

=========== Overall webpage:

- Set up event tracking for file downloads and abstract/bibtex expands.
 x https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide
 x http://www.blastam.com/blog/index.php/2011/04/how-to-track-downloads-in-google-analytics/
- Add schema.org annotations?

=========== Generation:

- Add 'succint' BibTeX option: abbreviate as much as possible, using standard rules

=========== GUI

- Add authors
- Add venues (conf / journal)
- Add papers
- Import BibTeX file

- Layout options per output format
 x List all authors vs 'With ...'
 x Which categories? In what order?
 x Notes for each output format?

- HTML-specific options
 x Include Google Analytics
 x Generate Sitemap
 x Collapsible abstract
 x Collapsible BibTeX
 x When to show bibtex
 x Show arXiv bibtex when available
 x Include links
 x Include pdf atr various stages of publication

Host Mercurial repo on BitBucket.

============================= MISC

1. Sketch the design first

More layout ideas: http://designshack.net/category/articles/layouts/

04. Check your character count:
"45-75 characters per line is generally accepted as safe for comfortable reading," says Trent Walton, founder and designer with Paravel. "There's a quick trick to ensure your responsive or fluid design supports this. Place a line of dummy text on your page with an asterisk at character 45 and an asterisk at character 75. Now test the site to make sure it resizes within these parameters."
